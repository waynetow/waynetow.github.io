Welcome to my online portfolio on github! I use this space to showcase projects I've worked along with my work history and education. 

### Experience

I've had the opportunity to work at several startups, learning as much as possible while creating a positive impact on the product experience. My product philosophy: Start small and have lots of grit. Create simple experiences that delight your customers and deliver value. Expect that you'll fail a lot in the process, but never stop learning and make each version better than the last.
